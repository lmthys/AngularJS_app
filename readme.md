<h1>Welcome to our AngularJS Application with a Laravel Login</h1>
<br>
To start
  <br>
  Go into child/ 
  <br>
  and start laravel: `php artsian serve`
  <br>
  Then go into childrens-app/
  <br>
  You may have to edit the signup.ts file (weird error, need to fix that)
  <br>
  just remove and put back something and save
  <br>
  then run: `ng serve --open`
  <br>
  this should make the application pop up in your browser!
