Welcome to our AngularJS Application with a Laravel Login 
To start
  Go into child/ 
  and start laravel: php artsian serve
  Then go into childrens-app/
  You may have to edit the signup.ts file (weird error, need to fix that)
  just remove and put back something and save
  then run: ng serve --open 
  this should make the application pop up in your browser!
